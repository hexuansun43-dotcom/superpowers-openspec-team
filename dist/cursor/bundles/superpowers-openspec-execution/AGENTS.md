# Agent Workflow

This workflow is explicit opt-in. Do not apply it by default. Only apply it when the user explicitly asks for this workflow or names it in chat.

When the user wants the three-stage delivery path:

1. Explore and converge with Superpowers
2. Lock the confirmed behavior with OpenSpec
3. Return to Superpowers for implementation, testing, and verification
4. Archive the OpenSpec change when complete

If `.superpowers-memory/` exists in the repository, read it at the start and update it before the session ends.
